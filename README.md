Welcome to Wallpaper Hub, a visually stunning wallpaper application developed using Flutter and integrated with the Pexels API.

## Key Functionalities

- Seamless integration with the Pexels API, providing access to a vast collection of high-quality wallpapers.
- Download and set wallpapers directly on your mobile screen.
- Efficient search functionality to find specific wallpapers based on your preferences.
- Categorization of wallpapers for easy exploration and discovery.

I'm proud to have developed an app that combines functionality, aesthetics, and a user-friendly experience. The Wallpaper Hub project allowed me to enhance my skills in REST API integration, data management, and creating visually appealing user interfaces.
